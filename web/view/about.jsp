                        <p>Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford,
                            Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English
                            football. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club
                            in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath
                            to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.

                            Manchester United have won the most trophies in English club football, including a
                            record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields.
                            They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa
                            League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA
                            Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight
                            of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English
                            club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most
                            successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA

                Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the
                European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. In winning the
                UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they also became one of five clubs to
                have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League
                and Cup Winners' Cup).

                Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,
                and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester
                United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual
                revenue of €676.3 million,and the world's third most valuable football club in 2019,
                valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion). After being floated on the London Stock
                Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by Malcolm Glazer
                valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the
                club's debt. From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock
                Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club.</p>

                    <p>Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon
                        department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath. The team
                        initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880,
                        they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green
                        and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team. By 1888, the club had
                        become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's
                        dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which
                        ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club
                        starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of
                        the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name. After two seasons, the club was
                        relegated to the Second Division.
                        In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £300,000 in 2022 – the club was
                        served with a winding-up order. Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen,

                    for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name; on 24 April
                    1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed
                    managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured
                    promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The
                    following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended with the
                    club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911,
                    but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.

                    In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club
                    was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925.
                    Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest
                    position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal
                    benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent
                    that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who,
                    in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the 1938–39 season,
                    the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First
                    Division.</p>

                        <p>Newton Heath initially played at North Road near the tracks; The initial capacity was around
                            12,000, but management deemed such facilities insufficient for the club to join The Football
                            League. Expansion began in 1887 and in 1891 Newton Heath added two stands, each with a
                            capacity of 1,000 spectators. The highest recorded attendance for a match at North Road is
                            15,000 (meet Sunderland 4 March 1893). Audience numbers were similar when the team met
                            Gorton Villa on September 5, 1889.

                            In June 1893, after the Manchester Deans and Canons, the owners of North Road, revoked the
                            right to use the pitch from Manchester United, secretary A. H. Albut obtained the right to
                            use Bank Street in Clayton.The stadium had no stands at first, but before the 1893–94 season
                            began two more stands were built; one stand covers the entire length of one side of the
                            field and the other stands at the back of the goal named "Bradford end". At the other end of
                            the goal named "Clayton end", gradually built. Newton Heath's

            <p>first match at Bank Street was
                against Burnley on September 1, 1893, in which 10,000 spectators watched Alf Farman's
                hat-trick send Newton Heath to a 3–2 victory. The remaining stands were completed for the
                match three weeks later against Nottingham Forest. In October 1895, before a visit to
                Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-seat stand from rugby league club Broughton
                Rangers. However, bad weather made the match against Manchester City only 12,000 people to
                watch.

                When Bank Street was temporarily closed in 1902, captain Harry Stafford raised money to pay
                for the team's next away game at Bristol City and found a makeshift stadium at Harpurhey for
                the reserves' next game. meet Padiham. After financial investments, new chairman John Henry
                Davies spent £500 to erect a 1,000-seat stand with seats at Bank Street.

                However, after Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup in 1909, Bank
                Street became inadequate for Davies' ambitions; by February 1909, Old Trafford Stadium
                became Manchester United's new stadium name after the club bought the land for £60,000.
                Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 to build; The building was built by
                Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was 76,962 people on
                25 March 1939, during the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby
                Town.

                Bombing during World War II destroyed much of the stadium; The central tunnel at the South
                Stand is the only remaining part of this stand. After the war, the club received £22,278 in
                compensation from the War Damages Commission. As the field rebuild got underway, the team
                played home games at Manchester City's Maine Road; Manchester United must pay a rental fee
                of £5,000 a year, plus a small portion of the ticket proceeds. One of Old Trafford's
                significant upgrades is the roof, first at the Stretford End and later in the North and East
                stands. The pillars supporting the roof that obstructed the view of fans were replaced by a
                cantilever structure. Four 180-foot (55 m) tall lampposts costing £40,000 were first erected
                on 25 March 1957, each containing 54 bulbs. These columns were removed in 1987 and replaced
                with today's roof-mounted lighting system.

                Taylor Report's requests for a stadium with seats contributed to the reduction of Old
                Trafford's seating capacity to approximately 44,000 in 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was
                redesigned into three floors to increase seating capacity. to 55,000. At the end of the
                1998–99 season, the East and West stands were increased by one more floor, increasing their
                capacity to 67,000, and from July 2005 to May 2006, another 8,000 seats were added at the
                two corners of the stands. northeast and northwest. A new section of seating was used on 26
                March 2006, when an audience of 69,070 became a new record in the English Premier League.
                The record gradually increased until it peaked in March 2007 when 76,098 spectators watched
                Manchester United's 4–1 win over Blackburn Rovers, with only 114 seats available (out of
                76,212). In 2009, a rearrangement of seats reduced the number of seats to 75,957. Manchester
                United is the club with the average audience second only to Borussia Dortmund.</p>
